# Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory were used for rough work and development, and are not intended for reading. All of the finalised functions used to produce the final dataset (`data.csv`), along with documentation, have been included in the 'functions' Python files. Please see these files for details on how the dataset was constructed.

### Function files:

* `functions.py` - various helper functions to support the development process including loading, filtering, and plotting data.

* `functions_feature_computation.py` - functions which compute many of the features for the final dataset.

* `functions_interpolation.py` - functions which allow linear interpolation of the lap time (as well as any other feature).

* `functions_final_features.py` - functions used to build the final dataset.
